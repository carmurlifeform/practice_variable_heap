# practice_variable_heap
An implementation of a modified heap.

Rather than being a binary heap, this heap uses a value 2^x to determine the maximum amount of children each parent item may have.
The elements of the heap must implement the Java "Comparable" interface.

This project was made as practice for interviews and Micro internships.
